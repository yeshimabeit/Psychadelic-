  <h3>An end to industrial society as we know it.</h3>
  <p><strong>A few hundred years ago, all cultivated carrots were purple. I might as well be holding the very first carrot.</strong>I want to write a story about receiving vegetables. Being delivered these vegetables that are beautiful. Their colors are vivid and bright. But they are not fake, they are real. It is strange that they are so beautiful that they look fake, as if it is a subtle reminder that nature will also be more beautiful than anything manipulated. Beauty itself is spontaneous. Not within our control. It is organic. Human influence alone could never create something so beautiful. A <a href="cities.html">list</a> of cities where you can find us.</p>
  <p>I wanted to have a party, but instead I made this poem. This story. Stories are the foil that wrap up the love I have inside of me for everyone in the world and preserves it. Preserving it for generations to come. </p>
